I am a Ph.D candidate working with Prof. [Haim Schweitzer](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~haim/)
in Computer Vision and Data Lab
at University of Texas at Dallas.
My research interests are in data science with applications to 
computer vision and machine learning, with specific focus on anomalous patter detection, representative selection and feature selection/extraction.
