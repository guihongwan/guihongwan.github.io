I am a Ph.D candidate working with Prof. [Haim Schweitzer](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~haim/)
at The University of Texas at Dallas.
My research interests are in data science with applications to 
computer vision and machine learning.
I am interested in algorithms for efficiently processing, modeling,
and understanding large amounts of data.
What is unique in my approach is the leveraging of classical AI techniques.
I expect to show that using common AI techniques such as combinatorial search
can lead to significant improvements over state-of-the-art data analytics
for Feature Selection, Feature Extraction, Robust Principal Component Analysis,
and other data modeling techniques.
This will allows for understanding and visualization of large quantities 
of data,
and can be used to obtain scalable algorithms in data intensive areas such as
computer vision and large scale machine learning.
