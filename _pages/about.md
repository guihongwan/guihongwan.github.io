I am a Ph.D candidate working with Prof. [Haim Schweitzer](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~haim/)
at Computer Vision and Data Lab
at University of Texas at Dallas.
My research interests are in data science with applications to 
computer vision and machine learning.
I am interested in algorithms for efficiently processing, modeling,
and understanding large amounts of data.
